# W\*\*D\*\*

This React app is like [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), the free, simple and famous online word game.\
Unlike Wordle itself, this is a game of guessing 6-letter English words.

## Demo

https://wd-mu.vercel.app

## dictionary

We use word-alpha.txt from [this repository](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) as a dictionary to check if English words exist.\
The correct words are randomly selected from [Oxford Learner's Word Lists (5000)](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/wordlists/).
